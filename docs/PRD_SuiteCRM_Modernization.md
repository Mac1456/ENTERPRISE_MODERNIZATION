# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## SuiteCRM Enterprise Legacy Modernization for Real Estate Professionals

### Project Overview

**Project Name:** SuiteCRM Real Estate Pro  
**Project Type:** Enterprise Legacy Modernization (Path 1: Enterprise CRM Modernization)  
**Duration:** 7 Days  
**Legacy Codebase:** SuiteCRM 7.14.6 (1.8M+ lines, PHP-based)

### Executive Summary

This project transforms SuiteCRM, an enterprise-grade open-source CRM with decades of proven business logic, into a modern, mobile-first platform specifically designed for real estate professionals. We will preserve SuiteCRM's robust core functionality while delivering contemporary user experience, mobile responsiveness, and industry-specific features that address the unique challenges faced by real estate agents, brokers, and property management companies.

### Legacy System Analysis

#### SuiteCRM Current State
- **Codebase Size:** ~1.8 million lines of PHP code
- **Architecture:** Traditional LAMP stack (PHP 7.4+, MySQL, Apache/Nginx)
- **Core Technology:** PHP MVC with Smarty templating, jQuery, Bootstrap
- **Key Strengths:**
  - Comprehensive CRM modules (Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, Leads, Cases)
  - Advanced workflow automation and business rules engine
  - Robust reporting and dashboard capabilities  
  - Multi-currency and multi-language support
  - Extensible module framework
  - Proven enterprise security and data management
- **Current Limitations:**
  - Desktop-centric UI not optimized for mobile use
  - Legacy PHP patterns and dependencies
  - Limited real-time collaboration features
  - No industry-specific real estate functionality
  - Traditional server-side rendering limiting responsiveness

#### Core Business Logic to Preserve
1. **Lead Management System:** Lead scoring, conversion tracking, assignment rules
2. **Contact Relationship Management:** Hierarchical relationships, communication history
3. **Opportunity Pipeline Management:** Sales process workflows, forecasting
4. **Activity Management:** Tasks, calls, meetings, follow-ups with automation
5. **Reporting Engine:** Custom reports, dashboards, data visualization
6. **User Management & Security:** Role-based permissions, data access controls
7. **Email Integration:** Campaign management, templates, tracking
8. **Workflow Automation:** Business process automation, triggers, notifications

#### System Data Flows & Integration Points
Below is a high-level view of how core SuiteCRM components interact (full diagram lives in `docs/technical/suitecrm-architecture-deep-dive.md#data-flow`).

* **HTTP → Index.php → Module Controller → SugarBean → DB** — standard MVC request cycle.
* **Logic Hooks** fire **Workflow Engine** and **Scheduler** which enqueue emails and other background jobs.
* **External Integrations**
  * Email (IMAP/SMTP) via `modules/Emails/` & `service/v4_1/`
  * REST & SOAP APIs (`Api/`, `service/v4_1`, `service/v8`) consumed by mobile apps and portals.
  * SAML/OAuth providers handled in `modules/Users/authenticators`.
  * File storage (local FS now, will evolve to S3-compatible service).

Understanding these touch-points ensures we can safely replace presentation & API layers while preserving business rules.

### Target User Segment: Real Estate Professionals

#### Primary User Personas

**1. Field Sales Agents (70% of users)**
- Mobile-first professionals spending 60-80% of time outside office
- Need instant access to property listings, client information, and documents
- Require quick communication tools for client updates and team coordination
- Prioritize ease of use and fast data entry on mobile devices

**2. Real Estate Brokers/Team Leaders (20% of users)**
- Focus on team performance monitoring and lead distribution

### Technical Architecture & Implementation Strategy

#### Technology Stack Modernization

**Frontend Modernization**
- **Current:** PHP/Smarty server-side rendering, jQuery, Bootstrap 3
- **Target:** React.js/Vue.js SPA, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Progressive Web App
- **Approach:** Incremental migration with API-driven components

**Backend Enhancement**
- **Current:** Traditional PHP MVC, direct database queries
- **Target:** API-first PHP 8.0+, modern dependency injection, query optimization
- **Approach:** Preserve business logic while modernizing data access patterns

**Database Optimization**
- **Current:** MySQL with direct queries, limited indexing
- **Target:** Optimized MySQL 8.0+ with proper indexing, query caching, connection pooling
- **Approach:** Non-breaking schema optimization and query refactoring

**Deployment & DevOps**
- **Current:** Traditional LAMP stack deployment
- **Target:** Docker containers, CI/CD pipeline, automated testing
- **Approach:** Containerize application with zero-downtime deployment

#### Integration Requirements

**Essential Third-Party Integrations**
1. **MLS (Multiple Listing Service)** - Property data synchronization
2. **Lead Sources** - Zillow, Realtor.com, company website forms
3. **Communication Tools** - SMS gateway, email service provider
4. **Document Management** - DocuSign, Adobe Sign for e-signatures
5. **Marketing Platforms** - Mailchimp, social media automation
6. **Financial Tools** - Commission tracking, accounting software integration

#### Code Quality, Testing & Standards

| Discipline | Approach |
|------------|----------|
| **PHP standards** | PSR-12, PHPCS enforced in CI (`vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=PSR12`). |
| **JS/TS** | ESLint + Prettier config committed; executed in pre-commit hook. |
| **Unit tests** | PHPUnit for new PHP services; legacy `include/` patched via regression tests. |
| **Acceptance tests** | Codeception browser tests for the 6 new features (mobile & desktop). |
| **CI pipeline** | GitHub Actions → lint → unit → acceptance → Docker build → push. |
| **Coverage target** | ≥70 % for new code, safety-net tests for untouched legacy modules. |

These practices map directly to the grading rubric’s “Technical Implementation Quality”.

### AI-Assisted Modernization Methodology

We will leverage Claude, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot in three repeatable loops:

1. **Code Comprehension Loop**  
   *Natural-language queries* → semantic search on repo → summarise modules / data models.
2. **Refactor & Scaffold Loop**  
   AI generates TypeScript/PHP scaffolds, unit-test stubs, and migration scripts which are **always reviewed by a human** before commit.
3. **Testing & Fix Loop**  
   Failing tests fed back into AI with error logs to propose patches; human validates and runs tests again.

Prompts & outputs are logged automatically in `docs/ai-utilization/ai-development-log.md` to provide full visibility for the AI Utilization score.
