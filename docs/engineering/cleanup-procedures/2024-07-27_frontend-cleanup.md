# Frontend Cleanup Procedure - July 27, 2024

## 🎯 **Objective**
Clean up obsolete frontend files before restoring the golden commit (July 23-24, 2024) that contains the correct React source code with good UI and working lead management.

## 📋 **Context & Background**

### **Problem Statement**
- Current repo has working compiled frontend in `frontend/dist/` (good UI)
- Missing React source code needed for future development
- Obsolete files in `frontend/` root that reference missing source
- Need clean workspace for source code restoration

### **Target State**
- Clean `frontend/` directory ready for source restoration
- All obsolete files safely archived with full documentation
- Working compiled frontend preserved
- Clear path for modular development going forward

## 🔍 **Files Analysis**

### **Files to Archive** ❌
- `frontend/index.html` (722B) - Development HTML referencing missing `src/main.tsx`
- `frontend/.eslintrc.js` (513B) - ESLint config without corresponding source code
- `frontend/dev.log` (105B) - Development log file

### **Files to Preserve** ✅
- `frontend/dist/` - Working compiled frontend (our golden UI)
- `frontend/node_modules/` - Dependencies (may be needed for build process)

## 🛠️ **Archive Structure**

```
frontend/
├── _archive/
│   └── 2024-07-27_pre-source-restoration/
│       ├── README_ARCHIVED_FILES.md
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── .eslintrc.js
│       ├── dev.log
│       └── file_inventory.txt
├── dist/ (preserved)
└── node_modules/ (preserved)
```

## ✅ **Execution Steps**

### **Step 1: Pre-Flight Checks**
- [x] Archive structure created
- [x] Documentation written
- [ ] Current file inventory captured
- [ ] Git status clean

### **Step 2: Safe File Movement**
- [ ] Move files to archive with verification
- [ ] Create file inventory
- [ ] Verify no broken references

### **Step 3: Verification**
- [ ] Confirm working frontend still accessible
- [ ] Verify clean workspace
- [ ] Document completion

## 🔄 **Rollback Plan**
If needed, files can be restored:
```bash
cp frontend/_archive/2024-07-27_pre-source-restoration/* frontend/
```

## 📊 **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Clean `frontend/` root directory
- [ ] Working `frontend/dist/` preserved
- [ ] All archived files documented
- [ ] No broken references
- [ ] Ready for source code restoration

## 🔗 **Next Steps**
1. Git archaeology to find July 23-24 golden commit
2. Extract React source code from correct commit
3. Set up modular development structure
4. Restore lead management functionality
