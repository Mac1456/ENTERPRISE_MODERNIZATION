// AI-generated realistic budget scoring with market analysis
private function scoreBudget(array $leadData): int {
    // ... complex algorithm considering market prices, budget ranges, and realism
    $averageMarketPrice = $this->getAverageMarketPrice($leadData['preferredLocation'] ?? '');
    $budgetToMarketRatio = $maxBudget / $averageMarketPrice;
    if ($budgetToMarketRatio >= 0.8 && $budgetToMarketRatio <= 1.5) {
        $score += 25; // Realistic budget for area
    }
}
```

### 2. Geographic Assignment Logic
```php
// AI-implemented distance-based assignment with haversine formula
private function calculateDistance(float $lat1, float $lng1, float $lat2, float $lng2): float {
    $earthRadius = 3959; // Earth radius in miles
    $dLat = deg2rad($lat2 - $lat1);
    $dLng = deg2rad($lng2 - $lng1);
    // ... complete haversine implementation
}
```

### 3. Multi-Factor Agent Selection
```php
// AI-created weighted agent selection algorithm
private function calculateAgentAssignmentScore(array $agent, array $leadData, array $leadScore): float {
    $score = 0;
    $capacityScore = (1.0 - $agent['current_capacity']) * 30;
    $performanceScore = 25; // Base performance score
    $specializationScore = ($agent['specialization_weight'] ?? 1.0) * 20;
    // ... complex scoring with randomization to prevent bias
}
```

### 4. React Component Architecture
```tsx
// AI-generated modern React patterns with TypeScript
const handleAutoAssign = async () => {
    try {
        setAutoAssigning(true)
        const result = await LeadService.autoAssignLeads(selectedLeads)
        // Optimistic UI updates with error rollback
        toast.success(`Successfully auto-assigned ${result.assigned.length} leads`)
        refetch() // Refresh data
    } catch (error) {
        // Comprehensive error handling
    } finally {
        setAutoAssigning(false)
    }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

AI suggested several areas for future improvement:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML for dynamic scoring weight adjustment
2. **Real-time WebSocket Updates**: Live assignment notifications
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive lead conversion modeling
4. **Mobile App Integration**: Native mobile assignment workflows
5. **Third-party Integrations**: Direct MLS and CRM system connections

## Conclusion

AI-assisted development proved highly effective for implementing complex business logic while maintaining code quality and security standards. The combination of human oversight with AI code generation resulted in a production-ready feature that would have taken 3-4 times longer to develop manually.

The AI's ability to understand real estate domain knowledge and translate it into working code was particularly impressive, generating algorithms that reflected industry best practices and real-world constraints.
