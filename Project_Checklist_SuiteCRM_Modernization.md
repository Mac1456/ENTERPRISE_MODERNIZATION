- **`feature/mobile-dashboard`**: Feature 1 development
- **`feature/lead-management`**: Feature 2 development  
- **`feature/contact-management`**: Feature 3 development
- **`feature/communication-hub`**: Feature 4 development
- **`feature/property-search`**: Feature 5 development
- **`feature/transaction-pipeline`**: Feature 6 development

### Daily Merge Strategy
- Each feature branch merges to `development` when complete
- `development` merges to `demo` for daily demo builds
- Only tested, stable code merges to `main`

This comprehensive checklist provides the detailed, manageable steps needed to successfully complete the SuiteCRM modernization project within the 7-day timeline while following the user's requirements for modular development and proper git branching.
